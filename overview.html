            <article><p>The Standard Model of Particle Physics is a theory which tries to explain what everything in this (and potentially other) universe(s). It is currently comprised of 12 particles of matter, 12 particles of antimatter and 6 particles of force.</p>
    		<img src="Standard%20Model.png"/>
			<p>As you can see in this beautiful version of the actual Standard Model lovingly made by the author, we have arranged these particles into a slick table - the best thing about it: it can fit on the front of a t-shirt!
			Anyhow, as I have said, these particles are responsible for everything that is, was and will be (apart from a God if you are religious) so with these ingedients, you can make a universe.
			However, you'll need quite a few of them - the other day I calculated the number of all of these types of particles in one grain of sugar - it came to around 1,199,544,000,000,000,000,000, or 1.199544 x 10<sup>21</sup>!
    		<br>Enough of the jokes. You can see that some of the particles (the ones on the left) have a green background, whilst the ones on the right have a red background.
			These colours symbolize different types of particles - the green ones are called <strong>Fermions</strong>, and the red ones <Strong>Bosons</Strong>. They are very different types of things.
            <br>I will begin with the Fermions (the green ones). These particles ALL have a mass and are matter particles, so make up matter - protons, DNA, cells, humans - anything really.
			There are two groups - the two colours of the letters - the <strong>quarks</strong> (the yellow ones) and the <strong>leptons</strong>. The quarks make up all hadrons (particles with quarks in them).
			They are the constituents of the atomic nucleus - 
    		protons are made from two <strong>up</strong> quarks and one <strong>down</strong> quark, and the neutron made from one <Strong>up</Strong> quark and two <strong>down</strong> quarks. Yeah, I know.
			I thought there was nothing smaller than protons and neutrons?? Well - you thought wrong. <br>Now, let's look at the Leptons. These are similar to quarks, being fermions, but generally smaller.
			The most famous of these is the <strong>electron</strong>  - found in all atoms. The electron has two heavier cousins, the <strong>muon</strong> and the <strong>tau</strong>. Also, these particles have some cousins, called <Strong>neutrinos</Strong>.
			Each particle has its own neutrino - the <strong> electron neutrino</strong>, the <strong>muon neutrino</strong>, and the <Strong>tau neutrino</Strong>.
			The neutrinos are famous for being hard to detect but multiple - your body emits 13 of them every second, and billions of them pass through you every second from the Sun and other stars, but they have such a small mass and are so small themselves that they do not interact with very much at all.
			<br>
			So, let's pause there. To recap, Fermions make up all matter, all stuff - but not by themselves. They have to have something to make them <strong>go</strong>, to power them, to stick them together.
    		<br>
			This is where the Bosons come in (the red ones). This will sound very strange - these are <strong>force</strong> particles (what?!), which 'carry' or 'mediate' the four forces. Four forces? What? I thought there were loads - friction, upthrust, drag, etc. NO!
			Any of those forces are all results of these four fundamental forces. The forces are: 
			<ul>
				<li>Electromagnetic force</li>
				<li>Strong Nuclear Force</li>
				<li>Weak Nuclear Force</li>
				<li>Gravitational Force</li>
			</ul>
            I expect you've only heard of the last one. Don't worry! They are easy to understand. 
			<br>
			The electromagnetic force is the one responsible for magnetic attractions, electrical charge, and all forms of light - visible, x-ray, microwaves, radiowaves, gamma rays.
			<br>
			The Strong Nuclear force is responsible for holding quarks together in hadrons like protons.
			<br>
			The Weak Nuclear Force is responsible for particle decays, such as radioactivity and nuclear fusion.
			<br>
			You should know that Gravity is a warp in space-time which causes massive particles to be attracted to other massive objects. Or, the thing that keeps us on the ground.
			<br>
			As I said, these forces are transmitted or mediated by certain particles called bosons. Each force has a corresponding particle. So;
			<ul>
				<li>The Electromagnetic force is mediated by the <strong>photon</strong></li>
				<li>The Strong Nuclear force by the <strong>gluon</strong> (think it <strong>glues</strong> quarks together)</li>
				<li>The Weak Nuclear force by both the <Strong>Z</Strong> and <strong>W bosons</strong> (it needs two for different processes)</li>
				<li>And Gravity by, what? Well, we have not actually found a particle for gravity, and I personally don't think we need one, but there is a theorized particle called the <Strong>Graviton</Strong>, but there is <u>no</u> evidence for it's existence.</li>
			</ul>
			So there you have a simplified explanation of fermions and bosons.
			Wait! There is still a particle left! You might of noticed I haven't mentioned the Higgs boson. This particle mediates the Higgs Field, <u>not really a force</u>.
			It has been in the news recently, since it was discovered only in 2012, but theorized for decades by theorectical physicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Higgs">Peter Higgs</a>.
			It is responsible for giving particles mass. I could go on for centuries with a report on how it was discovered and how it works, but I won't, I'll just give you a picture:<br><br>

			<br>
			Quite complicated, isn't it?
			<br>
        
			So, I've talked about what the Standard Model is actually made up from, so how do we know about all this? Well, since the 1800's and Dmitri Mendeleev's Periodic Table we have been looking to find the most basic, most fundamental particles in our world.
			The first time humans had thought about this had been thousands of years before, with the Ancient Greeks, who believed that everything was made from 4 basic elements - water, earth, fire and water.
			However, since then we have learnt better. We have delved into smaller and smaller worlds, using different machines to do so. First with magnifying glasses and microscopes, to electron microscopes (which use electrons to 'see' instead of photons), to actual particles. 
			A famous first experiment was first performed by Ernest Rutherford in 1908, where he fired alpha particles (helium nuclei) at a sheet of gold foil and recorded what came back where. He discovered that some particles went straight through, others were deflected a little to one side, whilst some completely bounced back. However, only 13 years before, in 1897, J.J. Thompson conducted his famous cathode ray experiment, proving that electrons are negatively charged.
			Thompson believed in Lord Kelvin's idea that atoms were like 'plum puddings', a nucleus with electrons imbedded in the surface like berries in a Christmas pudding. So Thompson predicted that the alpha particles in Rutherford's experiment would go through the foil without being deflected. That is why it was such a major breakthrough.

			So, we realised that we had to get smaller, delve in deeper. And to do that we couldn't keep on using old methods, we had to get something with a smaller wavelength to see smaller stuff. Why? Well, anyhting that is smaller than the wavelength of something is invisible to that something because it can avoid the wave. We can't use light because it would require massive amouts of energy to get the light to that tiny wavelength and then we wouldn't be able to detect what comes back.
			Now, we had know that wavelength decreases as speed increases, from the formula <code>wavelength = wave speed/frequency</code>, so all we had to do was to get particles to really high speeds, so that their wavelength is really small (particles are also waves) How? With particle accelerators.<br>
			The biggest and most famous particle accelerator today is called the <strong>Large Hadron Collider</strong>, or the LHC, which is operated by <strong>CERN</strong>, the European Organisation for Particle Physics, and is located 200 metres underground at Geneva, Swizterland. It is a 27km-long circular tunnel surrounded by electromagnets which can accelerate particles around it over 11 times per second.
			There are two beams, each travelling in different directions, and they collide in one of the 4 particle colliders dotted around the ring, exploding into hundreds of different, exotic particles, which we detect and then we can deduce what the basic particles are. The four colliders, ATLAS, CMS, LHCb and ALICE all work on something different. For example, in 2012, CMS discovered the Higgs Boson, which was then confirmed by ATLAS.
			Other major particle accelerator include; SLAC, at Stanford University in USA, which has an accelerator over 2 miles long, except, unlike CERN, in a straight line. This is called a <strong>linear</strong> accelerator, whilst CERN is a <strong>synchrotron</strong>.
			<br><br>
			You will see that I measure the mass of the particles in a strange unit, which will look something like eV/c<sup>2</sup> or MeV/c<sup>2</sup>. These measurements relate to Einstein's famous equation; <code>e = mc<sup>2</sup></code>, which states that matter is related to energy. We can rearrange the equation to make <code>m = e/c<sup>2</sup></code>, a measurement of mass instead of energy. The 'eV' in the unit stands for electronvolts, the amount of energy gained by an electron moving across an electric potential difference of 1 volt. It is equal to approximatly 1.6e-19 Joules.
			This is a measurement of energy, so we can put it into the equation to get eV/c<sup>2</sup>. If it says MeV or GeV, or even TeV, this just means Mega, Gega or Tera electronvolts.
